# Knime Challenge
Vue application to add and manage nodes on a canvas

## Overview
The project is implemented in Vue 2. Here I aimed at several goals:
1. Create a structure as if it were a real application
1. Use basic technologies
1. Get close to the real-world tasks

#### What was done
1. Sketched in Figma
1. Created API mock with template-based data generation
1. Created a simple global theme

#### What else is worth doing in the case of a real rather than a test project
1. Use Vuex to store data
1. Use D3.js to control the canvas with zoom and pan
1. Clean code
1. Better comments
